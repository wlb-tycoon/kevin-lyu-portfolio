    description:
      "At Maxim, I led the development of a competition platform designed to engage users in a unique and interactive experience. The platform allowed participants to compete for magazine cover features, with real-time updates and automated scoring for over 10,000 submissions. I built the responsive frontend using React and Next.js, leveraging server-side rendering (SSR) and lazy loading optimizations, which reduced page load times by 35%. I implemented real-time leaderboard updates and user progress synchronization using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, enhancing the user engagement factor. I also introduced a micro-frontend architecture, refactoring the platform for better modularity and scalability. In addition to coding, I mentored junior developers, ensuring a high-quality, maintainable codebase.",

      "At Webflow, I spearheaded the development of a high-performance, data-driven dashboard aimed at providing users with real-time updates and insights. The frontend was built using React and Next.js, focusing on server-side rendering for rapid load times. To ensure smooth and efficient data handling, I integrated AWS services like API Gateway and Lambda for real-time updates and utilized React Query for optimized state management. I introduced a micro-frontend architecture, which allowed for easier scaling and maintenance. This project resulted in increased user engagement due to its fast and seamless interface. I also conducted code reviews and mentored junior developers, fostering team collaboration and improving overall productivity.",

    description:
      "During my time at Quora, I led the migration of several pages and components from legacy code to React, improving performance and enabling a more modern user interface. I integrated GraphQL resolvers to ensure smooth data fetching, allowing for faster and more efficient backend interactions. A key achievement was the execution of a large-scale data migration project, transitioning over 31 million shares to posts without any major issues. Additionally, I contributed to UI consistency by auditing and fixing content expansion behaviors for notifications. Through A/B testing, I optimized various user-facing features, enhancing the overall user experience and driving measurable metric improvements.",

    description:
      "At Discover Financial Services, I was part of the team responsible for developing the IRA Savings feature within a customer-facing application. Using React and TypeScript, I built a responsive and intuitive interface that enabled users to manage contributions, rollovers, and transfers seamlessly. The backend was powered by Spring Boot, and I integrated various REST APIs and SOAP services to handle dynamic data. I also worked on optimizing the front-end by caching assets with Redis and delivering static content via AWS S3, improving page load times and overall application performance. I streamlined deployment processes by automating Jenkins pipelines, ensuring faster delivery of new features.",

    description:
      "At Amazon, I was tasked with developing a customer service application that facilitated real-time communication between customers and agents. I designed and developed the UI using React and Redux in TypeScript, integrating a soft-phone/WebRTC solution to handle real-time voice calls. The application supported a high volume of interactions—over 150,000 calls per minute—so I worked closely with backend teams to ensure data persistence with AWS DynamoDB and Kinesis. I optimized real-time event handling, ensuring smooth transitions and responsiveness across the call control panel. Additionally, I played a key role in migrating data storage to DynamoDB, which resulted in significant cost savings. This project enhanced operational efficiency and user satisfaction.",
